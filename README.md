# Final Project: Impact of Social Media on Shopping Trends

### Why we care

We are interested in the field of social media because we know our data on social media has an impact on our lives. We want to better understand the way our data effects the way we network, shop, and other aspects of our daily lives.

### Examples of other projects on social media marketing:

  This project offers a data based insight onto trends found within social media shopping. The project discusses different ways app developers employ marketing strategies as well as the effect their strategies have.
- [10 Social Media Statistics You Need to Know in 2020](https://www.oberlo.com/blog/social-media-marketing-statistics)

  This project focuses on social media and it's influence on marketing as a whole. We are able to see a glimpse into statistics that address user demographics and the view point of companies in regard to social media marketing.

  This project gives insight into general social media trends, focusing on age demographics. This project summarizes the way different target groups use different types of social media platforms which may be useful in our interest in marketing.

### Some questions we have about social media marketing:

- What places in the US are the most receptive to social media marketing?
- How do different user groups feel about social media marketing?
- Does social media marketing work? Which ones are the most effective?

### How we can tackle these questions with data:

- Analysis of location data and marketing effectiveness can help answer what places are most likely to buy products advertised via social media.
- User demographics and surveys on social media marketing can indicate how certain age groups, genders, and races react to ads.
- Data on platforms and their marketing success can give insight on the overall effectiveness of social media marketing and which ones are the best at doing it.
