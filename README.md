# Final Project: Impact of Social Media on Shopping Trends

### Why we care

We are interested in the field of social media because we know our data on social media has an impact on our lives. We want to better understand the way our data effects the way we network, shop, and other aspects of our daily lives.

### Some questions we have about social media marketing:

- What places in the US are the most receptive to social media marketing?
- How do different user groups feel about social media marketing?
- Does social media marketing work? Which ones are the most effective?

### How we can tackle these questions with data:

- Analysis of location data and marketing effectiveness can help answer what places are most likely to buy products advertised via social media.
- User demographics and surveys on social media marketing can indicate how certain age groups, genders, and races react to ads.
- Data on platforms and their marketing success can give insight on the overall effectiveness of social media marketing and which ones are the best at doing it.
